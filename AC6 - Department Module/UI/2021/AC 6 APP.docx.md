**Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations**

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Verify that Figma designs and features are compatible across both web and app versions.
2. **Dimension Standardization:**
- Ensure all Figma designs have the same dimensions: 1920 x 1080 for web and around 360px width for mobile.

  **5.3Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design:**

- Strictly base all Figma designs on use cases of actors and maintain consistency with previous and newly added designs.

  -- Each actor should have different page in figma

- If the Figma profiles are already existing make sure all the actors have their own figma profiles and also wireframe those across all use cases for that actor
- Figma link (only) for reference (Figma profiles created by the previous batch): [https://www.figma.com/file/pzhw34xBvEK0hm5Yx4bh0P/Fusion-APP?type=design&nod e-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=J0f6T5YoUiKbp17u-1](https://www.figma.com/file/pzhw34xBvEK0hm5Yx4bh0P/Fusion-APP?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=J0f6T5YoUiKbp17u-1)
