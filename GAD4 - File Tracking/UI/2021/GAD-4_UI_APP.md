**Figma Profiles for GAD4 [File Tracking Module]**

**1. Module Description:**

The primary objective of the file tracking module is to establish, uphold, and oversee the creation, maintenance, and management of files, while systematically tracking their progress. This module facilitates the seamless transfer and receipt of files related to IIIT work, empowering students, faculty members, or designated individuals to engage in efficient file-related activities within the system.

The System allows people to share, view, track, and forward files and can be used by other modules to implement a specific ‘file-motion’ workflow.

**Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations**

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Yes, figma designs are compatible with both web and app versions.
2. **Dimension Standardization:**
- Yes, all Figma designs have the dimensions around 360px width for mobile.

**5.3Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design:**

- No figma designs were made previously, we have made them from scratch.
