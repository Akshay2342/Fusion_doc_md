# Figma Profiles for GAD4 [File Tracking Module]

## 1. Module Description

The primary objective of the file tracking module is to establish, uphold, and oversee the creation, maintenance, and management of files, while systematically tracking their progress. This module facilitates the seamless transfer and receipt of files related to IIIT work, empowering students, faculty members, or designated individuals to engage in efficient file-related activities within the system.

The System allows people to share, view, track, and forward files and can be used by other modules to implement a specific ‘file-motion’ workflow.
