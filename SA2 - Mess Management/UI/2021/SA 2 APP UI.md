## 3. Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations

### 3.1 Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Verify that Figma designs and features are compatible across both web and app versions.

### 3.2 Dimension Standardization
- Ensure all Figma designs have the same dimensions: **1920 x 1080** for web and around **360px width** for mobile.

## 4. Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design

- Strictly base all Figma designs on use cases of actors and maintain consistency with previous and newly added designs.
- Each actor should have a different page in Figma.
- If the Figma profiles already exist, ensure all actors have their own Figma profiles and wireframe those across all use cases for that actor.
