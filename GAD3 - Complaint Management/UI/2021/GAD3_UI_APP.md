**Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations**

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Verify that Figma designs and features are compatible across web and app versions.
2. **Dimension Standardization:**
- Ensure all Figma designs have the same dimensions: 1920 x 1080 for web and around 360px width for mobile.

  **3.3Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design:**

- Strictly base all Figma designs on the use cases of actors and maintain consistency with previous and newly added designs.

  -- Each actor should have a different page in Figma

- If the Figma profiles already exist make sure all the actors have their own Figma profiles and also wireframe those across all use cases for that actor
- Figma link (only) for reference (Figma Layout):
