1. **Module Description:** 

   The primary goals of this application revolve around facilitating the addition of new programs and overseeing the curriculum management process for various academic offerings provided by the Institute. The application aims to empower each program to efficiently update and manage its curriculum, specifically catering to different batches within the program. Through this platform, programs can seamlessly introduce new courses and enhance the educational content for improved academic experiences across multiple batches. 

   The application's scope encompasses the comprehensive range of programs and their respective curriculums offered by the Institute. Users are provided with the capability to seamlessly access and review the curriculum and program requirements relevant to their academic pursuits. Through the application, users can effortlessly navigate and explore the specific curriculum details associated with each program, gaining a clear understanding of the educational components required for successful completion of their chosen academic paths.

**Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations**

**5.1 Cross-Platform Compatibility:**

Ensuring comprehensive quality assurance, our focus extends to meticulous checks for cross-platform compatibility in Figma designs. This involves thorough verification to confirm that all features seamlessly function and exhibit consistent design aesthetics across both the web and app versions. By prioritizing this aspect, we enhance accessibility and user satisfaction, delivering a uniform experience regardless of the chosen platform.

We Have different figma files for Web and Mobile application So they are compatible for both web and mobile applications .

**5.2 Dimension Standardization:**

In tandem with cross-platform considerations, dimension standardization plays a pivotal role in our design approach. We advocate for precision by mandating that all Figma designs adhere to specific dimensions. For web designs, the dimensions are set at a standardized 1920 x 1080 pixels, while mobile designs should target an approximate width of 360 pixels. This commitment to uniformity not only streamlines the development process but also fosters a cohesive visual identity, contributing significantly to an elevated and consistent user experience across diverse devices.

In all the mobile figma pages ,dimensions have been targeted with an approximate width of 360 pixels and height of 1004 pixels.

3. **Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design:**

\- Strictly base all Figma designs on use cases of actors and maintain consistency with previous and newly added designs.

-- Each actor should have different page in figma

\- If the Figma profiles are already existing make sure all the actors have their own figma profiles and also wireframe those across all use cases for that actor

\- Figma link (only) for reference (Figma profiles created by the previous batch): <https://www.figma.com/file/pzhw34xBvEK0hm5Yx4bh0P/Fusion-APP?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=J0f6T5YoUiKbp17u-1>
