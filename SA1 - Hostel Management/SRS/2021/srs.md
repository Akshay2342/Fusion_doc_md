# Module Name - Hostel Management
**Student Mentor:** Nimesh Nikhil (21BCS148)

## Overview of the module

The Hostel Management module is an integral part of our project, catering to students, caretakers, and wardens. For **students**, it offers streamlined functionalities like requesting guest rooms, managing allotted rooms, registering complaints, and accessing notices. **Caretakers** can efficiently handle tasks such as approving leave, managing inventory, and overseeing student-related information. **Wardens** have central oversight, managing guard shifts, notice boards, room assignments, and generating relevant reports. The module aims to enhance hostel administration by providing role-specific features, fostering efficient communication, and simplifying various management tasks. The implementation includes secure API endpoints to ensure a user-friendly and organized hostel management system.
