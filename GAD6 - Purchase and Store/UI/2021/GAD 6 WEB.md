# Figma Profiles for [GAD-6 Purchase and Store]

## Module Description

This module can be used to file an indent by faculty/staff/employee members, and then the indent can be approved by authorities. The main objectives of the module include managing stocks, ensuring a transparent system, and keeping track of the application status and payments involved. An indenter is allowed to fill indent form(s), which will be sent for approval to the concerned person (Director/Registrar). After approval, the procurement procedure will be sent for approval to the department/section admin. Once approved, the procedure is initiated, and when the items are delivered, an entry of procured items will be made in the stock tables, followed by payment for the items received. All details of the items/stock of the respective department and section can be viewed by their respective admin. The global admin/PS admin can view all the global item/stock details and manage transfers.
