## **Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations**

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Verify that Figma designs and features are compatible across app version only.

2. **Dimension Standardization:**
   - All Figma designs have the same dimensions around 360px width for mobile.

3. **Actor-Oriented Use Case-Based Design:**
   - All Figma designs are strictly based on use cases of actors and have a maintained consistency with previous and newly added designs.
   - Each actor has a different page in Figma profiles.
