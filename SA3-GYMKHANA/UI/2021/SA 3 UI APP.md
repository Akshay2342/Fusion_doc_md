## 4. Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations

### 4.1 Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Verify that Figma designs and features are compatible across both web and app versions.

### 4.2 Dimension Standardization
- Ensure all Figma designs have the same dimensions: 1920 x 1080 for web and around 360px width for mobile.

### 4.3 Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design
- Strictly base all Figma designs on use cases of actors and maintain consistency with previous and newly added designs.
- Each actor should have a different page in Figma.
- If Figma profiles are already existing, ensure all actors have their own profiles and wireframe those across all use cases for that actor.
