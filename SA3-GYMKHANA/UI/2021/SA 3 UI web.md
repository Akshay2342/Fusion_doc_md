## Figma Profile Design Guidelines and Additional Considerations

### 5.1 Cross-Platform Compatibility
- The Figma designs and features are compatible across both web and app versions.

### 5.2 Dimension Standardization
- All Figma designs have the same dimensions: 1920 x 1080 for web and around 360px width for mobile.

### 5.3 Actor-oriented Use Case-Based Design
- Strictly base all Figma designs on the use cases of actors and maintain consistency with previous and newly added designs.
- Each actor should have a different page in Figma.
- If the Figma profiles are already existing, make sure all the actors have their own Figma profiles and wireframe those across all use cases for that actor.
