The Placement Cell module facilitates streamlined student-employer interaction, including resume creation and tracking, employer communication, interview scheduling, feedback collection, and analytics. It efficiently manages the logistics of interview scheduling, ensuring timely coordination between students and employers, enhancing the overall placement process.

The Placement Cell module at IIIT Jabalpur encompasses three primary actors: students, the chairman, and the Training and Placement Officer (TPO). Students utilize the module for tasks such as resume creation, submission, and interview scheduling, actively participating in the placement process. The chairman provides strategic guidance, offering oversight to ensure alignment with the institute's goals. The TPO plays a crucial role in managing day-to-day operations, facilitating communication between students and employers, overseeing interview scheduling logistics, and maintaining the overall efficiency of the placement process.
